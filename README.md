# Maternal-Health-Risk-Predictor
The projects tries to classify the risk related to maternal health on three risk level(high, mid,low). The dataset is collected from kaggle and contains seven fields. For the data, we checked the distribution of data for different risk levels and separated the dependent and independent variables.  Plotting the graph using seaborn library gave us a clear understanding of the data distribution. Dataset is splitted for test and train dataset. Upon applying Logistic regression, the accuracy score was 0.61. Applying Decision tree with gin impurity increased the model accuracy sharply to 0.85. Random forest gave an accuracy of 0.86 and tuning the hyper parameters made the model better with accuracy 0.88. Random forest is a better model compared to support vector which was not able to generate better output.
